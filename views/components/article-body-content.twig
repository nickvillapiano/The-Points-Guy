        With most schools on break and warm weather to enjoy at many destinations, summer is a great time to travel. It’s also, unfortunately, the peak season — and that means higher prices for hotels, flights, car rentals and other related expenses. Luckily, there are <a href="">plenty of travel rewards</a> cards that can help you keep costs down thanks to their lucrative sign-up bonuses, not to mention other benefits that make your trip more enjoyable. Over the next few weeks we’ll be looking at the top cards based on your travel plans, starting with the best options for flying today.

    <h1>
        The Alaska Airlines Card is Especially Great for Transferrable Miles
    </h1>
    <p>
        If you’re planning on flying <a href="">Alaska Airlines</a> to Hawaii or any other destination this summer, this card could be a good option. It’s currently offering a sign-up bonus of 30,000 miles (enough for a round-trip economy award within the US) after you spend $1,000 in the first 90 days. You’ll earn 3 miles on eligible Alaska Airlines purchases, and 1 mile per dollar on everything else.

            cardtitle: 'Alaska Airlines<br>Visa Signature Card',
            cardimg: '<img src="images/cc_alaska.png" alt="Alaska Airlines Signature Card" >',
            endorsement: 'One of the best kept secrets in transferrable miles. Even if you never fly to Alaska, these miles can be used with a dozen major airlines.',

            related: 'Alaska Airlines Visa Signature Card'
        }
    %}
    <p>
        Cardholders also get an annual round-trip coach companion fare, which lets a friend or family member travel with you for free (you’ll need to pay $121 and up in taxes and fees). You can even pair this perk with a status match to Alaska Mileage Plan MVP Gold 75k to get guest upgrades and bump these companion fares up to first class, as TPG Editor-in-Chief Zach Honig did last year. This card has a $75 annual fee, and no foreign transaction fees.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, keep in mind that you can get significantly more value from several of these cards if you maximize certain benefits. For example, if you use the Southwest Rapid Rewards Premier Card to earn the Companion Pass and get virtually free travel for one of your friends or family members, the value will far surpass the $651 you’ll get from the sign-up bonus. And while the 10,000 MQMs you’ll earn as part of the sign-up offer for the Platinum Delta SkyMiles Credit Card aren’t factored into the $525 valuation listed below, those MQMs and any additional ones you earn by meeting certain spending thresholds help you get Delta elite status, which we value at $790-$6,820 depending on the tier.

        If you’ve spent any time on this site or are at all interested in the points and miles hobby, you know that credit card sign-up bonuses are a great way to quickly earn points or miles that can be used toward flight, hotel and other travel redemptions. However, not all rewards currencies are created equal — which is why I created my monthly valuations series to pin down an exact worth in cents for the points and miles used by the major travel loyalty programs.

        To show you just how lucrative these sign-up bonuses can be, below I’ll run through 10 cards with offers that equate to $500 or more in value. (As you’ll see, some get you more than double that amount.) All values are calculated based on my latest valuations, and I subtracted the annual fee from the points/miles valuation if the card charges it within the first year.

        Two Options for American Airlines Flyers

        This card earns you 2 miles per dollar spent on American Airlines purchases, so even if you end up paying for your flight instead of redeeming miles you’ll earn valuable rewards toward a future redemption. Plus, you and up to four people traveling with you will enjoy a free checked bag on domestic itineraries and Group 1 boarding.

        Cardholders also get 10% of their miles back when they redeem for an award flight, and get access to reduced-mileage awards. This card charges no foreign transaction fees, and the $95 annual fee is waived for the first 12 months. Currently, the sign-up bonus is 30,000 miles after you spend $1,000 in the first three months of account opening — that’s enough for a round-trip MileSAAver award within the US.

        There’s another strong option for American flyers, though it comes with a $450 annual fee: the Citi AAdvantage Executive World Elite MasterCard, which includes full Admirals Club membership and a statement credit toward TSA PreCheck or Global Entry. You can also 10,000 elite-qualifying miles when you spend $40,000 on this card in a calendar year. This card is currently offering a sign-up bonus of 60,000 AAdvantage miles when you spend $5,000 in the first three months, and it doesn’t charge foreign transaction fees.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you can see, there are plenty of travel rewards cards that will get you well over $500 in value from their sign-up bonuses alone. Also keep in mind that my valuations are on the conservative side; you can often get even more out of your points and miles if you redeem for a hotel stay or award flight that would cost thousands of dollars out of pocket. Plus, this post doesn’t even touch on more premium cards like the Platinum Card from American Express that come with steep annual fees but also offer perks like a $200 annual airline fee credit. In any case, hopefully this post has made it clear that credit card sign-up bonuses are one of the best ways to reap the rewards of the points and miles hobby quickly!
